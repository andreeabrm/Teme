    <h3>Rules for Autocomplete</h3>

    <h5 style="font-style: italic; color: grey; font-weight:normal;">Posted on March 19, 2019</h5>

    <p style="line-height: 140%;">
        Autocompleting text with known values seem like an easy problem to solve, but so so so many UIs
        get it wrong. I see this frequently enough that, rahter than complain about them invidually, I thought
        I'd just write down the set of rules they often break.
    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 140%;">
        There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing to do, but there should be
        a good reason for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these rules don't apply if
        a field must be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following
        these rules should always result in at very least a sane experience:
    </p>

    <ul style="line-height: 140%;">
        <li>Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other options
            must always go below the one matching what they typed. </li>

        <li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type "Fr" I want "Fresno" not "San
            Francisco."</li>

        <li>After prefix matches, it can fall back to subtring matches. Starting with substring matches
            would almost always be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning
            not somewhere in the middle.</li>

        <li>If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequence matching. This
            is only useful in some cases.</li>

        <li>If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to approximate
            matches. This is rarely necessary to provide.</li>

        <li>Matches should be sorted aplhabetically.</li>

        <li>When one option is the prefix of another, put the shortes one first.</li>

        <li>The matching sould probably be case insensitive unless there are two options that differ
            only by case. In that case (pun intended), prefer the one that more closely matches the user's
            input.</li>

        <li>The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term) must be a different key 
            than the action to accept the first suggestion unless you have to do something first to start 
            using autocomplete suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should never have to take extra
            steps to not use autocomplete.
        </li>
    </ul>
