            The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger
            foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. 
            Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the 
            primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs 
            in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent and is a popular pet due to 
            its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
